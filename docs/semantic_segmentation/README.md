# Semantic Segmentation

To implement 2D semantic segmentation for indoor scenes, we train [DeepLabV3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611) based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2). We use the [training set of ScanNetV2](https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet/blob/master/Tasks/Benchmark/scannetv2_train.txt) for training and we use [NYU label IDs](http://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannet_benchmark/labelids_all.txt).

## Requirements

You need to install Detectron2, and we recommend the 0.4 version with PyTorch 1.6, please refer to the [installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.1/tutorials/install.html).

## Run

We provide the trained model, you can download it from [here](https://zjueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/guohaoyu_zju_edu_cn/EY8mLcUOek1OgFmxtQ_G6mIBnbSSB7C0m5VztblG_cztXw?e=t3rUb0) and run inference by:
```shell
python inference.py
```
